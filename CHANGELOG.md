## [1.0.2]

### Changed

- Project name is now auto-detected from `angular.json` instead of always prompting the user to type it
  - If exactly one project's `root`/`sourceRoot` contains the selected folder, it is used automatically
  - If multiple projects match, a Quick Pick list is shown for the user to choose
  - If no projects match (or no `angular.json` is found), a free-text input box is shown as a fallback

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release
